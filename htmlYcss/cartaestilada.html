    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester. The start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so, which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted, we were most intrigued by the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H20 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3).</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104).</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know. Thanks.</p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

    <h6>Polynesian chicken dance</h6>
    <p>A little-known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens to encourage their livestock to be fruitful.</p>

    <h6>Icelandic Brownian shuffle</h6>
    <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor and shuffling their bodies in tiny, rapid movements. Some believe this inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</p>

    <h6>Arctic robot dance</h6>
    <p>Originally thought to be a traditional dance with stilted movements in Northern Alaska and Canada, it was later discovered that the dancers were simply moving like this because they were cold.</p>

    <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">exotic research page</a>.</p>
